# Potential Improvements

- Accessibility (mainly around the TODOs list)
- Allow users to create a "complete todo" without having to edit it on the TODOs list (potentially reuse the "Edit todo" modal)
- Allow users to apply filters in an arbitrary order (the current order is hardcoded as name -> description -> status -> priority)
